# SARS-CoV-2 Spike multidms analysis

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike homologs as seen in our manuscript 
_Jointly modeling deep mutational scans identifies shifted mutational effects among SARS-CoV-2 spike homologs_.
This repository contains the code in the form of a jupyter notebook,
as well as the source code for generating the web page.

To run the notebook:
1. clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/matsengrp/SARS-CoV-2_spike_multidms.git
```
2. install the requirements
```
pip install -r analysis_requirements.txt
```
3. run jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
