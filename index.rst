Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike homologs using `multidms`
=======================================================

This page contains a single notebook with all code used
to produce the analysis in our manuscript:
*Jointly modeling deep mutational scans identifies shifted mutational effects among SARS-CoV-2 spike homologs*.
The purpose of this is two-fold: 1. for code availability and reproducibility of our manuscript analysis,
and as an example of how the `multidms` API might be used in your own analysis.
